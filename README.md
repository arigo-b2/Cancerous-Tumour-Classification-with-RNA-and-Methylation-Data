## ðŸ§¬Cancerous Tumour Classification with RNA and DNA Methylation-Data

Accurate classification of cancer samples â€“ differentiating between â€˜Primary Tumourâ€™ and â€˜Solid Tissue Normalâ€™ is a challenge in cancer diagnostics, with significant implications for patient outcomes and treatment strategies. Advances in high-throughput molecular techniques, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation profiling, offer new avenues for improving the precision of these classification (Cantini et al., 2021; Wojewodzic & Lavender, 2024). However, it remains unclear which molecular data type provides predictive power for classifying cancer samples. RNA-seq measures gene expression levels, while DNA methylation captures epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression. Understanding which data type yields superior performance in cancer classification could enhance the development of personalised medicine approaches in oncology. 

In this study, machine learning classifiers, such as neural networks, will be applied to both DNA methylation and RNA-seq datasets. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to determine which data type offers better classification outcomes. Feature selection and normalisation techniques will also be explored to optimise the modelsâ€™ predictive power by applying these models to both labelled datasets and the â€˜mysteryâ€™ dataset, this research will provide insights into the effectiveness of each data type in cancer classification.
The findings aim to contribute to the broader discussion of molecular dataâ€™s utility in cancer diagnostics. By comparing DNA methylation and RNA-seq data, this research may help clarify which biomarkers offer the most reliable information for classifying cancer samples across various tissue types (Cantini et al., 2021; Wojewodzic & Lavender, 2024). This work could inform future biomarker selection and improve machine learning models for cancer diagnostics, benefitting both research and clinical practice. 

This study aims to investigate the comparative predictive power of DNA methylation and RNA-seq data in classifying cancer samples. Specifically, we seek to answer the question: which data type performs better in distinguishing between â€˜Primary Tumourâ€™ and â€˜Solid Tissue Normalâ€™ samples? Leveraging datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which includes both gene expression and DNA methylation beta values across a range of tissue types â€“ including breast, colon, kidney, liver, and lung cancers â€“ two machine learning models will be developed. One model will be trained on RNA-seq data and the other on DNA methylation data, with their performance evaluated to determine which is more effective in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, the models will be tested on a shared â€˜mysteryâ€™ dataset, which lacks specific tissue information, to assess the modelâ€™s ability to generalise across different tissue types. 

RNA-seq and DNA methylation provide distinct insights into cancer mechanisms. RNA-seq offers a direct measure of gene expression, while DNA methylation represents an epigenetic mechanism that can either silence or activate gene expression by modifying DNA accessibility. These epigenetic changes are known to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, making DNA methylation a potential early indicator of cancer (Wojewodzic & Lavender, 2024). Meanwhile, RNA-seq provides immediate transcriptional information, reflecting active cellular processes. This distinction highlights the need to compare the performance of these data types in classification tasks. 

Previous research has demonstrated the utility of both data types in cancer research. For example, Cantini et al. (2021) showed that combining muti-omics data, including RNA-seq and DNA methylation, significantly improved cancer classification accuracy by capturing complementary biological information. Wojewodzic and Lavender (2024) also found that DNA methylation data, when used with machine learning models, offers highly accurate cancer classifications. These findings underscore the potential of both data types in diagnostic applications.
